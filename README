•	Implemented Distance vector protocol on top of servers using UDP in C++, where servers update their routing table on arrival of a new packet from neighbour containing respective neighbour’s routing table. 
•	Designed the protocol such that routing packets are sent periodically or on a user request.
•	Included user commands such as update: which updates the cost between two servers, step: sends the updated routing tables right away, display: displays the current routing table of the server.
